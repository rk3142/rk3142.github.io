            I joined Comviva as a Software developer in 2016 with no knowledge about software development. All I had was my problem solving skills and never give up attitude. Started off with developing APIs doing simple CRUD operations and soon launched into the big league of developing Subscription Engine and Content Downloads. After working on a couple of applications, I moved to live streaming domain.  Created a live movie channel whose scheduled can be updated on the fly and can have features like ad-insertion as well as relaying feed from other channels.

            After being promoted as Senior Developer, I was showered with the opportunity to lead back-end development on a music application. Apart from developing its APIs, I also contributed to its system design considering it's highly available and scalable infrastructure.

          This work presents a Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system that helps radiologists in differentiating malignant and benign bone lesions in the spine on Computed Tomography (CT) images usingSupport Vector Machines(SVM). The CT images are segmented using Snakes or Active Contour Model to retrieve the Region of Interest(ROI). From the segmented images, Haralick features are calculated. These features are then passed to the SVM classifier. With the help of SVM model generated, the data are classified into benign and malignant nodules. The performances of different kernel functions are compared.

          This was my first project as a software developer. The application had contents like pictures, poems, games and videos segregated into different age groups. I worked on the backend of this application written in Ruby on Rails. I worked on login, favorite, content streaming, content download and subscription engine of the product. I also did unit testing, load testing of the product.

          Let's take small steps in protecting our environment while purchasing online
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Me and fellow mates developed this project for a Graduate level course ESaaS at Columbia University.

          The project allows user to make informed decision while purchasing products online. The consumers can select the product on the basis of greeness score and they can then be re-directed to the respective e-commerce site. 

          The backend of this product is developed on <mark>Ruby on Rails</mark> and the Front-end is developed on <mark>React</mark>. A complete CI/CD pipeline was developed on <mark>Heroku</mark>.

          I am very proud of having this project in my portfolio.

          Say Hello to your world of creating custom forms
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          This is a project which me and fellow mates developed for a Graduate level course Advanced Software Engineering at Columbia University.

          This is a Backend as a Service where you can provide us with your custom form template. Once the form template is registered, you can provide those template to the end-user and use our APIs to save the data. We maintain separate namespace for every template.

          So you see!! You don't need to know any back-end language now to store data of your users. We are here to help.
